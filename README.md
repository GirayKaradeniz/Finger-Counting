# Finger-Counting
This project uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to count the number of fingers held up in front of a camera. The code captures video from the default camera, processes each frame to detect hands, and counts the number of extended fingers. It can distinguish between right and left hands and displays the finger count on the video feed in real-time.
